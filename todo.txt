Must do:
- fix quote on deploy
- get more data
- make dimensions of the plot depend on viewport
- bugfix on x-axis spacing

- Make sure the scraping scripts work on overtime
- start doing the automated scraping
    - error handling on automated scraping
    - putting the info into the DB



- 4th quarter bug
- x spacing bug
- program the unhappy path



- Handle data points that occur at the same time

- get data
- bad path for game ID request

Bugs:
- Some fouls def missing
- panning gets stuck when x-axis spacing increased


====

Nice to have:

- handle overtime
- fix labels when zooming
- fix tooltip overflow
- Zoom button
- Add quarter marker to full game

make list of ID's
    figure out how to take data slowly using the nba api 
    
- faint gridlines?
- Make y axis minimum of 0

Things I did poorly:
key management
unique key in hashtable (curry on curry)

Note: easiest way to get game ID's:
https://stats.nba.com/scores/05/03/2019
0041800233

0041800226

funny things:
curry on curry
nene
nba api team names and 2k gaming
